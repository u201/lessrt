LESS is a 3D radiative transfer model which can simulate large-scale spectral images and remote sensing data.
The main features include:
* Simulating spectral images
* Simulating perspetive and fisheye camera images
* Simulating multiangle BRF (bidirectinal reflectance factor)
* Albedo simulation
* Thermal infrared image simulation
* Upwelling and downwelling radiation over rugged terrain with realistic trees
* ...
