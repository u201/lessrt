## Features

* Simulating spectral images
* Simulating perspetive and fisheye camera images
* Simulating multiangle BRF (bidirectinal reflectance factor)
* Albedo simulation
* Thermal infrared image simulation
* Upwelling and downwelling radiation simulation over rugged terrains with realistic trees
* ...
